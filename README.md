this project is part of our course at simplon school

### Microsoft Cloud Developer

### Goals:


For this project you will therefore build a complete website allowing you to create, discover and share memes (animated or not).


Your front will need to be done in React and deployed on Azure.

There will be a login system for your users.

The site will be open and the memes will be public, but to create a new one, the user will need to login. He will also have access to all the memes he has already created, which he can delete if he wishes.

To create a meme, the user has 2 choices:

  - upload a meme already ready that he will have done himself on his computer
  - (BONUS) create it via your site. You can offer a memes creation page (example: https://giphy.com/create/gifmaker)
